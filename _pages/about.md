I am currently a Professor of Robotics and AI at the School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China. I received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2010, the M.Eng. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Danwei Wang (Life Fellow of IEEE, Fellow of Academy of Engineering, Singapore).

From 2018 to 2024, I successively held the positions of Research Associate, Research Fellow, and Research Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at NTU. In 2024, I joined Shandong University as a full Professor.

My research interests include mobile robotics, multi-robot systems, telerobotics, and cybersecurity. I am dedicated to advancing robotic theory and technology while applying these innovations to address industrial challenges. I served as the lead investigator in a focused project, Development of Three Key Technologies for Automated Quay Cranes, funded by the Singapore Maritime Institute under Singapore's Maritime Transformation Programme. This project involved close collaboration with PSA International Pte Ltd, one of the world’s largest port operators. Additionally, I was a core investigator in three focused projects under Singapore’s National Robotics Programme, aimed at developing autonomous environmental service vehicles and next-generation high-fidelity teleoperation systems for unmanned driving.

I am an Associate Editor for several prestigious journals in robotics and automation, including the Journal of Field Robotics, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, and IEEE Control Systems Letters. From 2020 to 2024, I served as an Associate Editor for IROS, a flagship robotics conference.

I collaborate with renowned universities and research institutes worldwide, including those in the U.S., U.K., Europe, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong.

I am looking for Ph.D. Students, Master Students, Postdoctoral Research Fellows, Research Engineers with diverse backgrounds, including Mechanical Engineering, Automation, Computer Science, Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Control Engineering, etc. I will support researchers and students in visiting and collaborating with overseas universities.
