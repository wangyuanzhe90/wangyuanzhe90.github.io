I am currently a Professor in Robotics at the School of Control Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China. I obtained the B.Eng. degree from Southeast University, Nanjing, China in 2010, the M.Eng. degree from Beihang University, Beijing, China in 2013, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore in 2019. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. Danwei Wang (Life Fellow of IEEE, Fellow of Academy of Engineering, Singapore). From 2018 to 2024, I have worked as a Research Associate, a Research Fellow, and a Research Assistant Professor in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. I joined Shandong University as a full Professor in 2024.

My research interests include mobile robotics, multi-robot systems, telerobotics, and cybersecurity. I am dedicated to develop innovative robotic theory and technologies, and deploy them in industrial applications. I am the lead investigator of a focused project, Development of Three Key Technologies for Automated Quay Crane, funded by Singapore Maritime Institute under Singapore's Maritime Transformation Programme. In this project, we collaborated with PSA International Pte Ltd, one of the largest port operators in the world. I am the core investigator of three focused projects funded by National Robotics Programme of Singapore, aiming at developing autonomous environmental service vehicles and next-generation high-fidelity teleoperation for unmanned driving.

I am an Associate Editor for a few prestigious journals in robotics and automation, including Journal of Field Robotics, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles, and IEEE Control Systems Letters. I have served as an Associate Editor for IROS, a flagship conference in robotics, from 2020 to 2024.
